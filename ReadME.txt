Key elements are selected using document.querySelector and assigned to variables for further use.

In app.js :- 

navHomeBtn, navTranslteBtn, and navSettingsBtn are assigned to specific elements with corresponding IDs.

Variables like translateCard, learnCard, contributeCard, and contactUsCard are assigned to HTML elements representing cards within the application.

Event listeners are attached to specific cards, like translateCard and learnCard.
When a user clicks on the translateCard, the script sets the window.location to '/translate', redirecting the user to the '/translate' URL. Similarly, clicking on the learnCard redirects the user to 'learn.html'.

In translate.js :-

gttsBtn, cameraBtn, uploadBtn, textArea: These variables are assigned to HTML elements with IDs 'gtts-btn', 'camera-btn', 'upload-btn', and 'textarea', respectively.

A new paragraph element (line) is created using document.createElement('p').
The line element is assigned the class "line" and the ID "last-line."
The inner HTML of the line element is set to Ready to roll !.
The line element is appended as a child to the HTML element with the ID 'textarea'.

line.scrollIntoView({...}): This method is used to scroll the line element into view with a smooth scrolling behavior. It is positioned at the end of the block, inline, and nearest.

An event listener is added to an HTML element with the ID 'webcam-banner' (presumably a banner).
When the banner is clicked, it opens a new tab ('_blank') with the GitHub repository link 'https://github.com/vivekkushalch/Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-System/'.

addTestLines(totalLines): An asynchronous function that adds test lines to the 'textArea'. It creates paragraph elements with the class "line" and the inner HTML set to 'Hello'. The number of lines added is determined by the totalLines parameter.
