Key elements are selected using document.querySelector and assigned to variables for further use.

In app.js :- 

navHomeBtn, navTranslteBtn, and navSettingsBtn are assigned to specific elements with corresponding IDs.

Variables like translateCard, learnCard, contributeCard, and contactUsCard are assigned to HTML elements representing cards within the application.

Event listeners are attached to specific cards, like translateCard and learnCard.
When a user clicks on the translateCard, the script sets the window.location to '/translate', redirecting the user to the '/translate' URL. Similarly, clicking on the learnCard redirects the user to 'learn.html'.
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
contactUsCard.addEventListener("click", function() {
This line adds an event listener to an HTML element with the id or class contactUsCard. It listens for a "click" event on that element.

window.location = 'contact.html';
When the "click" event occurs on the element mentioned above, it sets the window.location to the 'contact.html' URL, effectively redirecting the user to the 'contact.html' page.

contributeCard.addEventListener("click", function() {
Similar to the first line, this adds an event listener to an HTML element with the id or class contributeCard, listening for a "click" event.

window.location = 'https://github.com/madhav2k22/SignTalk.git';
When the "click" event occurs on the element mentioned above, it sets the window.location to the GitHub repository URL, redirecting the user to the repository page.

navTranslteBtn.addEventListener("click", function() {
This line adds an event listener to an HTML element with the id or class navTranslteBtn, listening for a "click" event.

window.location = '/translate';
When the "click" event occurs on the element mentioned above, it sets the window.location to '/translate', redirecting the user to the '/translate' URL.

navSettingsBtn.addEventListener("click", function() {
Similar to the previous lines, this adds an event listener to an HTML element with the id or class navSettingsBtn, listening for a "click" event.

navHomeBtn.classList.remove("active-nav-btn");
Removes the "active-nav-btn" class from an HTML element with the id or class navHomeBtn.

navSettingsBtn.classList.add("active-nav-btn")

gttsBtn, cameraBtn, uploadBtn, textArea: These variables are assigned to HTML elements with IDs 'gtts-btn', 'camera-btn', 'upload-btn', and 'textarea', respectively.

A new paragraph element (line) is created using document.createElement('p').
The line element is assigned the class "line" and the ID "last-line."
The inner HTML of the line element is set to Ready to roll !.
The line element is appended as a child to the HTML element with the ID 'textarea'.

line.scrollIntoView({...}): This method is used to scroll the line element into view with a smooth scrolling behavior. It is positioned at the end of the block, inline, and nearest.

An event listener is added to an HTML element with the ID 'webcam-banner' (presumably a banner).
When the banner is clicked, it opens a new tab ('_blank') with the GitHub repository link 'https://github.com/vivekkushalch/Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-System/'.

addTestLines(totalLines): An asynchronous function that adds test lines to the 'textArea'. It creates paragraph elements with the class "line" and the inner HTML set to 'Hello'. The number of lines added is determined by the totalLines parameter.
